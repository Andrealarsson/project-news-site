# News Site

The name of my project this week is "Tasty Magazine" for people who likes food and wine. The magazine have responsive design for mobile, tablet and computer, with a header (title, logo, navbar), one big news and eight small news and a footer.

## The problem

I had some problems but solved most of them with google and my team. I didnt plan as well as i thought, because i put in to much style in css and had to start from the beginning to understand. I had a lot of time, i just need to plan my time better next time and stick to the layout that i planed.
